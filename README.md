# PrologLab practice/refrence, school activity


Activity 3. Write the following statements as Prolog clauses, in the order given:
If it is raining or snowing, then there is precipitation.
If it is freezing and there is precipitation, then it is snowing.
If it is not freezing and there is precipitation, then it is raining.
It is snowing.
What answer does Prolog give to the following queries:
Is it freezing?
Is it raining?
Can you rearrange the clauses so that Prolog can give better answers?
Activity 4. Write the following statement as Prolog clauses:
Mammals have four legs and no arms, or two arms and two legs.
A horse is a mammal.
A horse has no arms.
Can Prolog derive that a horse has four legs?

relationship: grandparent, sibling, cousin. Enter the following family relationship as
Prolog clauses.
Use queries to find out:
Who is Ana’s grandparent?
Who is Jill’s sibling?
Who is Sarah’s cousin?
If multiple answers exist, make sure to get all of them.
Activity 6. Write a Prolog definition of the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
Then use it to compute gcd(4, 10), gcd(15, 36), and gcd(25, 55).
Activity 7. Write a Prolog program to find the last item in a list.
